## History:  

### Build 2.0.0.0 - 2017-06-23
- **MANDATORY UPGRADE - HARD FORK ACTIVATION WILL OCCUR ON BLOCK 115000**
- **IMPORTANT FOR EXCHANGES** Version 2 has changed the way operation hashes (OPHASH) are calculated **for existing operations**. This means a prior v1  operation with ophash "X" will now appear with ophash "Y" when querying via the JSON-RPC API. This is relevant when scanning for user deposits. Make sure you do not confuse an old deposit as being new since it now has a new ophash. **Ensure** that your system is aware of this OPHASH calculation change before installing V2, since this change occurs on installation even before the hard-fork. Please note, OPHASH was not designed as an ID however we recognize many are using it this manner. Also note, you can still search for operations using old ophash value via JSON-RPC API.
- **Introducing Protocol v2.**
  - https://github.com/PascalCoin/PascalCoin/blob/master/PascalCoinWhitePaperV2.pdf
  - **Core Changes:**
    - New safebox hash calculation algorithm to allow safebox checkpointing
    - Updated OPHASH algorithm for calculation operation hashes, now includes all operation data
    - Improved difficulty target calculation to obtain a more stable average blocktime of 5 minutes, given abrupt hashpower fluctuations
    - Bug-fix for China region users
    - Anti-spam measures
      - New Consensus Rule: A block can only contain 1 zero fee operation per sender account. If a sender account issues 2 or more zero-fee operations, that block is invalid.
    - SafeBox now stored in chunks to facilitate checkpoint distribution
	- Reintroduce block operations into pending pool when it is orphaned
  
  - **Added Checkpointing:**
    - Checkpoint created on every 100'th block
    - Added network operations to transfer Checkpoint chunks (compressed)

  - **Added In-Protocol PASA Exchanging:**
    - New Operation: List Account, used to list an account for public or private sale 
    - New Operation: Delist Account, used to delist an account from sale 
    - New Operation: Buy Account, used to purchase an account lised for sale
    - Updated Operation: Transaction, can be used in place of Buy Account operation in private account sales
      
  - **RPC API Changes:**
    - All changes are backwards-compatible for current 3rd-party infrastructure providers (exchanges, wallets).
    - However, use of param "ophash" has been changed in V2, see "Operation Object changes" section to know how to use "old_ophash" param value    
    - JSON changes:
      - Account Object changes:
        - Added param "state"  (values can be "normal" or "listed". When listed then account is for sale)
        - If "state" is "listed" then will fill next values:
          - "locked_until_block", "price", "seller_account" 
          - "private_sale" : Boolean value 
          - "new_enc_pubkey" : (Only on "private_sale" = true) - HEXASTRING with private sale encoded public key
		- Added param "name": String
		  - Name available chars: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789!@#$%^&*()-+{}[]\_:"|<>,.?/~
		  - Name first char: (cannot start with number): abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz!@#$%^&*()-+{}[]\_:"|<>,.?/~
		  - Name lenght: Empty or 3..64 chars length
		- Added param "type": Integer (Valid values from 0..65535)
        
      - Operation Object changes:
        - Changed param "ophash": Current returned value of "ophash" is not the same than previous builds (changed calculation method)
        - New param "old_ophash": Will return previous "ophash" value only for old blocks (prior to v2 protocol activation)
        - New param "subtype" : Based on "optype" param, this param allows to discrimine point of view of operation (sender/receiver/buyer/seller ...)
        - New param "signer_account" : Will return the account that signed (and payed fee) for this operation
        - Param "enc_pubkey": Will return both change key and the private sale public key value
        - About method "findoperation" and "ophash"
          - Due to changed "ophash" param value calculation, method "findoperation" will find old "ophash" values too
          - This is to avoid 100% compatibility, but remember that returned "Operation object" will contain "ophash" value calculated in new format only (you can read "old_ophash" value in older blocks)

  - Bugs fixed

### Build 1.5.5.0 - 2017-04-11
- Corrected fee result on RPC calls as a negative number on "Change key" operations
- Corrected PASCURRENCY value to be limited as a 4 decimal digits on RPC calls
- JSON-RPC method "getaccountoperations" changed: if param "start" is -1, will include pending operations, otherwise not
- Fixed bug: On "getaccountoperations" if an account had a lot of operations (receive tx included) then sometimes app crashed when executing depth search.
  - Note: High depth search is slow because it search always starting from current state, going backwards, in order to return past balance. This can be a slow method on some account with high transactions volume.

### Build 1.5.4.0 - 2017-03-14

- Added Network Timestamp Adjustment (NAT) to calc valid timestamps
  - Minimum 4 active connections to calc median used for NAT, otherwise use local timestamp
  - Based on IP's (to prevent a malicious IP timejacking, each IP is only used once)
  - Removed IP's and recalculated after disconnecting (to prevent malicious node connecting/disconnecting for timejacking)
- New blocks will not be accepted if using future timestamp greater than NAT timestamp + 15 seconds (also, mantaining current protocol rule >= lastBlock.timestamp)
- Network protocol fixed to 5-5 (Nodes with version prior to 1.5 will not be allowed)
- Added protection for non included operations on a block, to prevent continuous sending. Only will resend operations once.
- Bug #27 fixed: Invalid timestamp on FPC (https://github.com/PascalCoin/PascalCoin/issues/27)
- JSON-RPC
  - Method "getconnections" added "timediff" to know timestamp diff of node
  - Method "payloaddecrypt" added "unenc_hexpayload" result value with HEXASTRING of unencrypted payload
- Fixed some "Random Memory access violation errors" bugs found caused by multithreading and disconnected nodes

### Build 1.5.3.0 - 2017-03-06

- Fixed issue #23: RPC findoperation fails to find operation by opHash
- Miners best practices: Sending new job with new timestamp every 30 seconds
- Buffering last 10 sent jobs to miners
- Small delay prior to destroy a connection to prevent exception handling
- Minor logs changes


### Build 1.5.2.0 - 2017-03-03

- Added a jobs buffer for miners. This will allow to submit old job solutions (limited buffer). (Fix the "tx" issue)
- Miner jobs will not be sent every time a transaction is received, thet will be buffered and sent every few seconds (Fix the "tx" issue)
- Better network performance, allowing more operations and nodes thanks to buffering before relaying
- Daemon: Allow select on ini file how many connections can handle
- Fixed a locking when deleting connections

### Build 1.5.1.0 - 2017-02-20

    - Will return a Public key JSON object
  - Method "decodepubkey" allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
    - Will return a Public key JSON object
  - Method "changekey" allows params "new_enc_pubkey" or "new_b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
  - Method "getwalletaccounts" allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
  - Method "getwalletaccountscount" allows params "enc_pubkey" or "b58_pubkey" (if used together, returns error if not match)
