### Disbursements

Proposals are paid daily in PASC using USD spot-price conversions.

Daily-payments are calculated as follows
- SALARY: this is X / 365  where X = salary
- FIXED-PRICE: X / (term length) where X = fixed price quantity
- PAY-PER-HOUR: contractors submit hours and paid on submission
- PAY-PER-DELIVERABLE: paid manually after deliverable/milestone submission
- 
### Priorities

Proposal priorities are relevant if daily foundation revenue falls below daily expenditures. Proposals with highest priority are funded first until funds exhausted.
Unfunded proposals are essentially furlowed and contractor must stop working until funding becomes available again.

## Rationale

Since time is required to develop and deliver GOVBOT DAO smart-contract in PascalCoin, a PIP-based approach will be used in the interim period.
